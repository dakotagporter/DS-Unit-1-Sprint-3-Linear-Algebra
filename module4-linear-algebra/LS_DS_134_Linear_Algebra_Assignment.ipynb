Study authors used cadavers to see if a relationship between brain weight and other more easily measured physiological characterizes such as age, sex, and head size could be determined. The end goal was to develop a way to estimate a person’s brain size while they were still alive (as the living aren’t keen on having their brains taken out and weighed). "
